A simple economic model based on individual preference ranking.


# TODO #

Find a nice way to represent future leisure time.
* Can I count it as "inventory" and ignore the fact that it is consumed as it
  is produced?
* Should it be represented as a % of a specific period of time? I.e. 20% of the
  next 100 days are leisure time. If so, what time period is relevant?

Figure out how to easily predict future inventory and consumption.

Figure out how to represent preferences for future goods.

Figure out how to represent 2nd or 3rd order wants.
* This has to do with capital goods.
* Example: I want a net more than I want a leisure day. But this isn't because
           I enjoy the net more than the leisure day. It is because having the
           net will result in more leisure days in the future (because my
           productivity will go up).
           I need to represent the preference for (more) future leisure days
           over (fewer) present leisure days in the preferences. I can't just
           assume the conclusion and put the preference for the net directly in
           the Person's preferences.
